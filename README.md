# 🧠 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This is a **personal data engineering and analytics portfolio project** that demonstrates my skills in building **data pipelines**, **data warehouses**, and **analytical models** to generate actionable business insights.  

It follows **industry-standard data warehousing practices** — from data ingestion to analytics — using SQL Server, Python, and visualization tools.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture** — structured into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers — for a clean and scalable data flow.

### 🔹 Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data as-ingested from various source systems.  
- Data is loaded directly from CSV files into the SQL Server database without transformations.

### 🔹 Silver Layer
- Cleans, validates, and standardizes the data.  
- Focuses on data quality, consistency, and preparation for analysis.

### 🔹 Gold Layer
- Contains **business-ready data** modeled into **star schemas**.  
- Supports reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.
