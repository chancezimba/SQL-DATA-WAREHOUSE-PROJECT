**Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This is a data engineering and analytics project that is building data pipelines, data warehouses, and analytical models to generate actionable business insights.

The project is designed to showcase industry-standard data warehousing practices, including data architecture design, ETL processes, data modeling, and reporting.


**🏗️ Data Architecture**

The project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern — organized into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers — to ensure a structured and scalable data flow.

**Bronze Layer**
Stores raw data as-ingested from the source systems.
Data is loaded directly from CSV files into the SQL Server database without any transformations.

**Silver Layer**
Cleans, validates, and standardizes the data.
This layer focuses on improving data quality, consistency, and structure to make it ready for analytics.

**Gold Layer**
Contains the final, business-ready data modeled into star schemas.
This is the layer used for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.


**📖 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a modern data warehouse and analytics system.

**Key Components:**

**Data Architecture –** Designing a multi-layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

**ETL Pipelines –** Extracting, transforming, and loading data into a warehouse using SQL scripts.

**Data Modeling –** Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for performance and analysis.

**Analytics & Reporting –** Writing SQL queries and generating insights for decision-making.

**🚀 Project Requirements**
**Data Engineering (Building the Data Warehouse)**

**Objective**
Develop a SQL Server–based data warehouse that integrates multiple datasets into a single analytical model.

**Specifications**

**Data Sources:** Import data from CSV files representing ERP and CRM systems.

**Data Quality:** Identify and fix inconsistencies and missing data.

**Integration:** Merge different data sources into a single unified model.

**Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of data models and transformations.

**Scope:** Focused on current datasets (no historical data tracking required).

**Data Analysis (Analytics & Reporting)**

**Objective**
Use SQL-based analytics to uncover insights from the consolidated warehouse.

**Key Focus Areas:**

**Customer Analysis –** Understanding customer distribution and activity.

**Product Insights –** Analyzing product performance and sales trends.

**Sales Reporting –** Tracking overall sales and performance metrics.

These analytics demonstrate how structured data can support data-driven decision-making.
