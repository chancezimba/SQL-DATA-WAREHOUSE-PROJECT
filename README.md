# 🧠 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This is a ** data engineering and analytics portfolio project** that demonstrates building **data pipelines**, **data warehouses**, and **analytical models** to generate actionable business insights.  

It follows **industry-standard data warehousing practices** — from data ingestion to analytics — using SQL Server, Python, and visualization tools.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture** — structured into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers — for a clean and scalable data flow.

### 🔹 Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data as-ingested from various source systems.  
- Data is loaded directly from CSV files into the SQL Server database without transformations.

### 🔹 Silver Layer
- Cleans, validates, and standardizes the data.  
- Focuses on data quality, consistency, and preparation for analysis.

### 🔹 Gold Layer
- Contains **business-ready data** modeled into **star schemas**.  
- Supports reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project showcases the **complete data warehousing process** — from raw data ingestion to analytical reporting.

### Key Components
1. **Data Architecture** – Building a multi-layered data warehouse (Bronze, Silver, Gold).  
2. **ETL Pipelines** – Extracting, transforming, and loading data using SQL.  
3. **Data Modeling** – Designing fact and dimension tables for efficient analytics.  
4. **Analytics & Reporting** – Writing SQL queries to extract business insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### ⚙️ Data Engineering (Building the Data Warehouse)

**Objective**  
Develop a SQL Server–based data warehouse that consolidates multiple datasets into a unified analytical model.

**Specifications**
- **Data Sources:** Import data from CSV files simulating ERP and CRM systems.  
- **Data Quality:** Identify and clean missing or inconsistent data.  
- **Integration:** Merge multiple sources into a unified, analytics-ready model.  
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and detailed data model documentation.  
- **Scope:** Focused on the current dataset only (no historization required).

---

### 📊 Data Analysis (Analytics & Reporting)

**Objective**  
Use SQL analytics to generate insights from the consolidated warehouse.

**Focus Areas**
- **Customer Analysis** – Understand customer distribution and segmentation.  
- **Product Insights** – Analyze product performance and contribution to sales.  
- **Sales Reporting** – Track sales trends and business performance metrics.
